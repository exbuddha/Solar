Guitar Fundamental Practices
============================

The concept of practice for any instrument is fundamentally one regardless of the style that is followed. It begins by breaking down movements of the body against the instrument to some level of granularity, referred to as interactions, such that it can be formulated meaning that the breakdown can be expressed uniformly across similar instrument parts; so that a pattern in the follower’s mind is formed for reasons such as simplicity of remembrance, repetition, and combining so that a structured process of instrument-specific performance becomes apparent to the follower and progress can be evaluated, measured, and made systematically. There can be many different breakdowns depending on the level of interest of and the skills sought by the practitioner, however there is a fine boundary line that can be drawn for any instrument characterizing the most basic practices focusing on the most fundamental interactions and their relationship with respect to each other, either simultaneously or chronologically over durations of time. Defining such a boundary for the guitar instrument is the goal of sections that follow.

Combination
-----------

As a general concept in music performance and practice, combination refers to grouping interactions of any category of practice (fundamentals) with the same or another category to generate new complex interactions that are useful in performance. Combination can be achieved for categories regarding the same or different body and instrument parts. Interactions can be lined up simultaneously in time or chronologically within durations of time. The outcome of this lining up (grouping) can either be given a brand new technique, which is just a naming for the combination, for the sake of simplicity in definition and expansion such as chords and trill, or remain as forms of practice that prove to be specially useful in performing a song. It is theoretically possible to come up with any combination physically possible but this leads to a very large number of exercises many of which less useful than many others. It is the role of the teacher and an observant practitioner to carefully and somewhat personally choose and sort the many possible combinations into groups that are useful for the purpose of performing music.

Coordination
------------

Coordination is a necessary skill that must be developed and perfected over time for any interaction over durations of time. This applies to all of music performance and is for all instruments. The reflection of order in music upon the physical interactions and their durational relation to one another within a combination is called coordination. This is a skill on its own that requires a level of atonement of the brain and the nervous system and their perceived interaction via all of the physical senses. For many of the fundamentals to become actionable, and therefore practicable, they need to be combined with another fundamental interaction, usually a trivial one, making coordination a necessary aspect of all fundamental practices for all instruments. As an example, all left hand fundamental practices must be coordinated with a basic right hand fundamental, such as a single pluck, in order to become audible and measurable by the practitioner. This fact constitutes a necessity for an accurate timing device, such as the metronome, that can aid the practitioner to start forming a structured understanding of order among durations of time by trying to measure the body and the instrument reactions with respect to the audible repetitive cue. Over time an accurate sense of timing becomes instilled in the practitioner’s mind and the metronome can be dropped as a tool or brought back only when there is a need for it.

Right Hand Fundamentals
-----------------------

**A. Pluck**

![Pluck](https://github.com/exbuddha/Solar/blob/master/doc/img/Pluck.png)

i. Pick
  - Pluck each string with the pick on the beat.
  - Use all possible directions. (down-down, down-up, up-up, and up-down) This will help develop both alternate and sweep picking skills.
  - Let the wrist and the hand rest in between picking.

ii. Finger
  - Pluck each string with the finger on the beat.
  - Use all possible fingers (p, i, m, a, and c) in both directions (up and down) just as for pick.
  - Let the hand and the fingers loosen up after each pluck.

*Notes:*
  - Good exercise for locating each string individually with respect to hand locations.
  - Be aware of tension in the hand and fingers at all times. Loosen up constantly and rest in the middle of the exercise as much as needed. It is very important to train the muscles to be efficient. This will be crucial for both health and accuracy in the long run.
  - Practice slowly to develop skill and keep the hand, wrist, and unused fingers relaxed at all times.
  - Give the hand good rest when tension starts to build up or becomes uncontrollable.
  - Always practice with a metronome.
  - Practice in faster tempos to develop speed and accuracy only after hand relaxation is fully learned and can be maintained in slower tempos.

**B. Picking (Pluck Chronological Combination)**

![Picking](https://github.com/exbuddha/Solar/blob/master/doc/img/Picking.png)

i. Pick
  - Pluck the strings with the pick on the beat starting with the string marked by the square.
  - Use all possible direction combinations. (down-down, down-up, up-up, and up-down) This will help develop both alternate and sweep picking skills.
  - Keep the movement of the wrist as smooth and uniform as possible.
  - Let the wrist and the hand rest in between pickings as much as possible.
  - Try to keep a constant intensity and loudness for all the notes.
  - Try to conserve movements and avoid traveling distances more than required with the wrist and the hand.

ii. Finger
  - Pluck the strings with the finger(s) on the beat starting with the string marked by square.
  - Use all possible finger combinations. (pp, pi, pm, pa, pc, ip, ii, im, etc.)
  - Use all possible directions per finger (up or down) but give preference to the natural directions. (down for the thumb and up for all other fingers)
  - Keep the unused fingers as relaxed as possible and as close as possible to the strings without accidentally touching the strings.

*Notes:*
  - Great exercise for locating strings with respect to one another. Also good for warming up.
  - Avoid tension at all times and give sufficient rest to the hand in between the exercises.
  - Use metronome at 2 beats, preferably with distinct note sound for the first beat, to develop sense of first interaction associating with the intention of the movement. This is specially important for the backward combinations such as 10, 14, 15, etc.
  - When a relaxed hand that consistently hits the right strings with ease is achieved, the goal of this practice is met. At that time, keep practicing regularly giving more precedence to the ones that feel more challenging to cement the skill.
  - When the practice is mastered, add the third string to the combinations which can be performed with sweep picking. Practice at or build up to faster tempos specially with the pick. Use the following picking directions:
  ![Sweep Picking Directions](https://github.com/exbuddha/Solar/blob/master/doc/img/SweepPickingDirections.png)

**C. Strum (Pluck Simultaneous Combination / Chord Picking)**

![Strum](https://github.com/exbuddha/Solar/blob/master/doc/img/Strum.png)

i. Pick
  - Strum the strings with the pick on the beat.
  - Use all possible directions (down-down, down-up, up-up, and up-down).
  - Assume rhythm playing style and let the hand and the wrist move naturally and with ease.
  - Try to hit all the strings as quickly as possible. In this exercise and despite the previous one, it is okay to let the wrist and the hand travel longer distances across the strings than normally required.
  - Keep both directions consistent in power and loudness.

ii. Finger
  - Strum the strings with each finger (a) or pluck them with multiple fingers (b) on the beat. These two styles constitute two different methods of finger strumming.
  - Use all possible fingers for (a) and all possible finger combinations for (b).
  - Use all possible directions for (a).

*Notes:*
  - Great for developing the skill to play chords accurately.
  - When using multiple fingers (b) make sure that all strings are plucked at the same time.
  - Keep the hands and the wrist relaxed at all times.

**D. Asymmetric Picking**

![Asymmetric Picking](https://github.com/exbuddha/Solar/blob/master/doc/img/AsymmetricPicking.png)

Pick or Finger
  - Practice exercises A and B in asymmetric time intervals shown above.

*Notes:*
  - Great for developing basic skills for playing melodies accurately.
  - Extend the exercise by combining it with itself and varying the patterns instead of repeating one over and over. This is a good way to enhance the skills for memorizing timing of melodies.
  - Always use metronome.
  - Start with slow tempos and work up to faster tempos.

**E. N-let Picking & Tremolo**

Pick or Finger
  - Tremolo an individual string or multiple strings back and forth equally spaced within the beat.
  - Use both down-up and up-down directions.
  - Break down the beat to 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, and 8-lets.

*Notes:*
  - Always use metronome.
  - This exercise becomes harder as the number of plucked strings grows. Practice at slower tempos if necessary to keep the plucks equally spaced in time.

**F. Articulations**

Articulations are variations of or additions to the fundamental interactions that give color and variety to music and performance. Each one is unique and it is best to practice each one separately in realistic situations that are useful for the style of music performance undertaken. There are some general ones across all instrument types and music styles. It is beneficial to put some thought ahead of time to come up with a list of possible ways to perform each articulation and then commit to practicing them as exercises regularly. Each practice can be taken up based on the need for that specific articulation or the interest of the practitioner. It is however beneficial to generally keep all of them in the loop. One key note to remember is to always pay attention to the timing when working on developing skills in playing articulations and use a metronome and an inquisitive ear to perfect accuracy in each skill. Below are the list of the well-known right hand articulations and techniques:
  - Tap
  - Tap Trill
  - Tap Vibrato
  - Tap Slide
  - Tap Harmonic
  - Pinch Harmonic
  - Whammy
  - Volume and Tone Control
  - Slide (for melodies extending beyond the range of the fretboard)

As a final note, remember that there are variations to performing articulations which are all valid. What matters most is to perform them comfortably without compromising their aesthetic quality. For self-practitioners it is a good general rule to compare the sound of the instrument, while practicing articulations, to their favorite performer and to try to make the same sound on their instrument.

**G. Muting**

While practicing an exercise when a wrong string is plucked or vibrated try to mute the unwanted and keep only the desired effect with a right hand finger that is free at the moment. This is a naturally developed skill that comes over time but can also be practiced by being aware of the sound of the instrument at all times or specially while playing a song.

Left Hand Fundamentals
----------------------

An important note to make regarding the left hand is that, depending on the guitar type, there are different forms that the hand can take. The classical guitar normally requires keeping a more rigid hand form with a thumb fixed behind the neck, roughly in the middle of all other fingers, giving support to them while keeping the finger tips perpendicular to the fretboard in order to avoid blocking strings adjacent to the string being used. While this form can also be used on acoustic and electric guitars, it is usually more desirable to keep a relaxed form with the thumb reaching or even resting on top of the neck and to keep the fingers slightly slanted. This gives the hand fluidity in playing faster melodies at the risk of blocking some strings below the target string or strings; but this usually is an advantage during playing solos because it keeps the guitar quiet even with more aggressive right hand movements. It is good to keep both playing styles in mind when practicing the left hand fundamentals regardless of the guitar type and to perform all of them in both styles.

As mentioned earlier, when practicing the left hand fundamentals it becomes important to combine them with the right hand fundamentals to be able to hear the notes. It is possible to completely let the right hand rest and only focus on the left hand and this is probably desirable for beginners. However, soon after some level of control in the movements of the left hand is developed, it is best to combine the two hand exercises. For the purpose of giving the left hand more attention it is a good idea to keep the right hand movements as simple as possible at the beginning. For example, use symmetric alternate picking for all the exercises first and start introducing variations to the right hand movements later on.

**A. Fingering**

![Fingering](https://github.com/exbuddha/Solar/blob/master/doc/img/Fingering.png)

  - Press each fret with a finger on the beat using both styles of releasing the last finger (a) and keeping the previous finger in place (b).
  - Use all possible orderings of fingers on each string starting from one finger to all four fingers per string and move up and down the strings in the same position. (1, 2, 3, 4, 1 & 2, 1 & 3, 1 & 4, 2 & 1, etc.)
  - Extend to use different strings per finger.

*Notes:*
  - Make sure that only the engaged fingers are pressing against the fretboard and the rest are relaxed and ready.
  - Try to shorten the length of the silence gap between two adjacent notes. This is a general rule that applies to all left hand fundamental exercises.<br>
  ![Shortening Silence Gaps](https://github.com/exbuddha/Solar/blob/master/doc/img/ShorteningSilenceGaps.png)
  - Try not to look at the fretboard while changing fingers.
  - Avoid tension in the fingers, the wrist, and the hand at all times and give sufficient rest to the hand in between exercises.
  - Make sure to practice using both hand forms.
  - The possibility space is rather large so make sure to cover all in time and not in a single sitting. The ultimate result and end goal of this exercise is to be able to practice the scales. At some point when all the permutations of the exercise become trivial for the hand, it is more beneficial to devote all or most of the time on just practicing scales. At that point, it is a good idea to also study music theory and learn about intervals and scales.
  - Always use metronome and start from slower tempos working up to faster tempos.

**B. Chords (Fingering Simultaneous Combination)**

  - Simultaneously combine exercise A to come up with all possible chord combinations and form them on the beat.
  - Expand to include the possibility of using bars wherever the same fret number is used for two or more strings. Practice bars with some caution and ease into those exercises. Be specifically careful with the 3rd and the 4th finger bars. Don't over-exercise them too quickly. Start with the 1st finger bar chords (full and partial bars) and introduce the others later on.

*Notes:*
  - The possibility space for this exercise is huge. Start slowly finding all permutations first. Number each one and draw diagrams if necessary to keep them organized in memory. Don't dispose any of them as they might become useful in alternate tunings. Try to memorize the well-known chords by their name. Sort by (1) aesthetically good sounding and (2) feasibility and usefulness and practice all of them in a round robin fashion giving more precedence to the ones that are tougher to hold and most useful in playing songs in the standard tuning.
  - For some chords, it is impossible or very hard to press all the fingers on the right string or fret at the same time. It is fine to construct those chords starting by placing some of the fingers first and then move on to the rest of them. When doing so, keep in mind that the initially placed fingers that are easier to construct chords from are not necessarily always the first ones you would want to place on the fretboard in a performance. So, make sure to try using the other fingers as the initial finger to develop the habit.
  - Be aware of tension building up in the wrist and the hand. This exercise specifically puts a toll on the left hand so take as much rest as your body needs.
  - Always use metronome as it is important to develop the skill of playing chords on time.
  - Once a chord is learned and the hand feels relaxed playing the chord, try an strengthening exercise for that chord by continuously holding and releasing the chord keeping the hand in its position. This is a specifically good exercise for playing the rhythm guitar.

**C. Positioning**

  - Expand on exercise A and add space between each fingering by changing the hand position ranging from -4 to 4 frets.
  - Start with fingering only on one string first then expand to all possible strings.
  - Gradually increase the distance to the range of 12 frets.
  - Ultimately, extend the exercise to more than one position change. Try making 3 and 4 jumps in a row or every two beats. This is a good opportunity to practice playing only the octaves up and down the fretboard.

*Notes:*
  - Great exercise for extending the practice of playing scales which helps in the development of the skill to play solos with ease.
  - Use minimal movement when changing hand positions. Try not to go too far in or too short of the position. Always make sure that the first finger is near the fret position you are moving to. Eventually during performance, you don't have to worry about the exact location of any finger if it is not important for the passage.
  - Just like exercise A, try to shorten the length of the silence gaps in between position changes.
  - Try not to look at the fretboard when changing positions or changing finger.
  - Always use metronome. Start with slower tempos and gradually increase the tempo.

**D. Articulations**

Similar to the right hand articulations, there are many that can be practiced individually or in combination with other fundamentals. Specially for the left hand there are a few articulations that are very well combined with the other skills and can produce crucial techniques that need to be mastered by any serious learner. Particularly speaking, hammer-on, pull-off, vibrato, trill, and bend are among these skills. They can be combined with the fingering and chord skills of the left hand, explained above, and the symmetric and asymmetric picking of the right hand to produce simple to complex phrasing variations that are essential in performance. There are ample resources available online and in book format to learn these techniques and their exercises and expand upon for personal purposes if necessary. As always, starting with a metronome is ideal for all of the left hand and coordination exercises. Below are the list of the well-known left hand articulations that can be practiced individually:
  - Hammer-on
  - Pull-off
  - Trill
  - Vibrato
  - Glissando
  - Bend
  - Bend Release
  - Bend Vibrato
  - Natural and Artificial Harmonic
  - Slide: Referring to the slide accessory, this is a whole new style of performance on its own and can be studied and practiced using already available material online or in book format. It also makes interesting combination exercises with other fundamental and articulation skills.

**E. Muting**

Similar to the right hand muting technique, while practicing an exercise when a wrong string is plucked or vibrated in any other way try to mute the unwanted effect and keep only the desired effect with a left hand finger that is free at the moment. This is a naturally developed skill that comes over time but can be also practiced by being aware of the exercise at all times or specially while playing a song. Use of the left hand fingers for muting are preferred over the right hand fingers when possible since it is a much quicker way of muting the strings, is more accurate, and doesn't interfere with the flow and timing of the right hand.

Practicality of Practice
------------------------

Fundamentals are a useful categorization of exercises for covering the entire range of techniques in performance. They are not meant to be used exhaustively for long periods of time unless in rare cases that a wrongly developed and memorized skill needs to be readjusted and fixed. The main usage of this approach is to learn about ones own shortcomings and to seek more realistic practices that aim to remedy those shortcomings. It is best to combine the practice of these fundamentals with more elaborate practices and playing full songs to make the process more enjoyable and fruitful. Overly repeating the fundamentals can put a toll on the body or the instrument and therefore it must be done reasonably and with a certain aim or end goal. The end goal of practice is to be able to play music. That should not be forgotten or overshadowed by the act of purely practicing.

The most important mental aspect of practicing the fundamentals is to keep a present mind at all times and to be aware of the posture of the body and the positioning of the instrument, the movements of the body, the physical responses of the instrument, and the relative placement of the body and the instrument parts. This is the aspect of practice that takes the performer far in the long run and makes a whole new range of skills and abilities open to him or her. Without the mental aspect, the act of practicing becomes a purely physical exercise which is useful in its own right but can only prepare the body for performing the physical movements required for playing the instrument. Accuracy, subtlety, control, speed, and body part independence, which are all important qualities of any performer come about more quickly when the mind is kept focused on the tasks and their effects on the body. This implies a certain quality of attention that is not particularly fun, specially for beginners, which emphasizes keeping a good balance between practicing and playing songs even more. Techniques and performance skills develop slowly and that rate is different from one person to another. Keeping up with the practices and making a regular habit of them is the key to overcoming setbacks in performance of any instrument.
