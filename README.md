### A Complete Paper On Music Analysis and the Nature of Human Cognition

  > I dedicate this work to my family, my father, my mother, and my brother, for giving me unconditional love and support throughout all my efforts, to Sir David Gilmour and his loving family for being an example of excellence and for brining so much joy in my life with their music and poetry, to all my music teachers for enlightening me, to all my friends for believing in my words, and to every being who enchant me with beauty.

At some level of influence during listening, musical changes only elicit rises and falls. Then, comes forth memory. As music is the most powerful form of experience available in our plane of existence taking us to heights traversable only in dream states, and because in our most natural form of understanding we are, or tend to be, as freely perceptive as we are when we listen to music, it can be derived that the fluid nature of human cognition is infused by the work of our memory totally and unconditionally.

Therefore, in all forms of receiving, a visitation into a similar pattern filling up our mind is sensed and required in turn. For this reason, I propose by guidance a method of analysis which I call in this paper 'Clock-ability' that answers almost all questions originating in and from the memory if one sets one's analytic mind on the right angle of view while inquiring into layers of knowing.

## Clockability

**Clockability:** Scientific apparatus for measurements in human perception of memory and the inter-relations it creates by expansion in the way nature intends. This is the most natural language for music theory and analysis.

Along the main approach to solving all problems in music theory, such as representation of notes and intervals, all commonly known conversions among them, chord naming and conversion, and phrase detection, there are three forms of entities or data types that are introduced in the context of any progressive step-wise spectrum or range in music theory:

  1. Progressor
  2. Regressor
  3. Templator

Progressor is the super-type of the two. It represents an "open known" differentiating amount of progression. It is generally relaxed on the notion of direction of progression, such as chord interval progressive units like m2, M3, aug., dim., 4th, 5th, etc.

Regressors are the well-known progressors that are closed in their effect with the differentiating amount, such as flat, natural, and sharp accidentals. (no openness in direction)

Templators are the most complex of the three. They extend progressor units to cover all change forms in progressive detection as complex as memory/thought units or visual vectorized units that can aid a robot in detecting perspective among objects in vision. They intend to have no limits in definition of their units, therefore are the best subjects for mathematical formulation in infinitely large continuum or fields. Musical octaves are an example of what a templator can represent.

It is important to remember that the definitions of Regressor, Progressor, and Templator are all respectively set on the scope of their elements within specific functionality. So, an element can be a Templator in its main/immediate scope and be a different one (Regressor or Progressor) in another scope. This explains, in essence, the purpose for the statement of "setting one's analytic mind on the right angle" at the beginning of this paper.

Below, I will recapture the knowledge of the system of music progression, as shown in the Java interface [Clockable<T>](https://github.com/exbuddha/Solar/blob/master/java/music/system/data/Clockable.java) in the included source code.

![Clockable System](https://github.com/exbuddha/Solar/blob/master/doc/img/Clockability-3.png)

**Element:** the most basic unit of data in the domain of clockable systems.

**System:** a collectively meaningful system of elements with arbitrary degree of complexity.

---

**Elementary:** the defining operative for relations that are in the most simplified form.

**Complex:** the defining operative for relations that are not elementary all the time.

**Definitive:** the defining operative for relations that are with no degrees of freedom.

**Undefinitive:** the defining operative for relations that are with some degree of freedom.

---

**Regressor:** the simplest well-defined normalized bit of data in clockable systems.

**Progressor:** the next well-defined non-normalized bit of data in clockable systems.

**Templator:** the most freely defined bit of data in clockable systems distinct from the two.

---

**Regressive:** the defining operative for cognitions and conversions that are the most restrictive with respect to their two-dimensional elements.

**Progressive:** the defining operative for cognitions and conversions that are the most expansive with respect to their two-dimensional elements.

**Templative:** the defining operative for cognitions and conversions that are totally free with respect to their n-dimensional elements.

**Systematic:** the defining operative for cognitions and conversions that are system-based with respect to their progressive elements.

---

**TemplativeRegression:** tabular three-dimensional functional systems that are restrictive in nature.

**TemplativeProgression:** tabular three-dimensional functional systems that are expansive in nature.

**Regressional:** conversional operations that expansively accept a regressor and a free object.

**Rotational:** axes of regressors, as simplified/linear systems that support restrictive data forms.

---

**Pendular:** attribute of axes that resemble motion of pendulums.

**Spiral:** attribute of axes that resemble motion of spirals.

**Sinusoidal:** attribute of spiral axes that resemble repetitive motions.

**Clockable:** attribute of all rotating axes of data.

**Convertible:** attribute of all axes of data that are on a continuum, and therefore convert.

  * All interfaces defined above, specially the templative functionals, are designed to reduce all complex operations into sets of well-defined one-way (normalized) tabular conversions that aid in organizing any system of relative inter-related knowledge, such as music theory and any other scientific system, with the aim of opening doorways to formulate and study them.
  * Remember that both TemplativeProgression and TemplativeRegression reflect or describe a space with functional ordering where the first generic type is for the items in the space, the second is an amount, and the third is a known unit.

In the following chapter, I will include excerpts that depict a large-scale view consisting of scales, intervals, tones, and forms which will aid the mind in understanding and explaining the most fundamental underlying thought forms during listening to and exposing oneself to music. These high-level concepts will help you in understanding your hearing process and in paving a defined path to the formulaic approach for the design of an ultimate music analysis system.

Be patient.
